Photo - how to take. How to send to Twitter. http://mashable.com/2009/05/19/twitter-share-images/
Logging - How to send to me?
How to disable the machine? Delete partition table? How can we test this?


Need to store last direct message received. Do this reliably.
Permissions - running as root.
encrypting the config file.
Integration with CoreLocation

What if it fails? How will the user know? Config program needs ramping up.

The Config tool needs much more work. Needs a passphrase

Design elements:
We should check twitter for direct messages when:
	External IP address changes
	Location Changes (from Core Location)
	At a time Interval (in hours)
	When 

config:
	Global Behaviour:
		twitter uid / password
		When to check for direct messages:
			time interval [xx]hours
			on change of location? []
			on external ip changing? []
		direct message password ["sadsdsds"]
	Behaviour when marked stolen:
		take pics?
			How often?
			twitter them back?	
		twitter location?
			How often?	
	RunTime persistent state
		last direct message received
		

Other cool things to do.
	email support
	remove
