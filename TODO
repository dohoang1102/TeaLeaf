ALL:
- Use the colour calibration wizzaed as an example of how to code the setup wizard 
- we will focus on twitter for 1.0. this means testing using the file, adding twitter, and then redoing the 
  config app to show only twitter (can still dynamically load.

DAEMON:
- need serious look at strings which will end up in the app, which come from the Internet. Stack Overflow check...
- Google URL should drop a pin and preferably give an accuracy.
- Security, authorization. This is a big area. Check apple docs.
- Core Location - is it Daemon safe??



CONFIG APPLICATION:
- Add Twitter config
- Preferences panel needs a better name than 'window'
- resolve issue with TableView focus ring bottom side near BWtoolkit widgets not visible (removed for now)
- Complete error checking in App Delegate
- Config file and application support directory needs to be root owned and perms 700
- Write Start / Stop Daemon routines
- The dameon indicator light should have some kind of kqueue thing going on, and received a signal if the state of the 
daemon changes
- Design and embed icon
- Remove embedded key strings where there should be constants
- Convert user displayed strings to localised strings
- Customise about box
- Undo functionality (can set the change flag manually)
- Change font size for infomational labels where appropriate
- Add formatter to various entry fields to limit field sizes
- Configure menu items
- menu item to save copies of current config (save / load menu items
- help sheet on first launch
- some more descriptive texts on table view
- boilerplate defaults
- look at espionage for changes to user interface that look cooler. icons next to each service name, for example.
-		and and enabled or on/off button.
- each tab will need us to discard changes or save them, rather than simply having a big "revert" button
- check window memory management
- decide on preferences. What is a better layout to mark the computer stolen?
- need to validate names of service instances which need to be unique.


GENERAL:
- Write proper README file
- Convert database to Core Data

INSTALLATION AND PACKAGING:
- Write PackageMaker
- Develop build routines 
- Add sparkle
- Write uninstallation processes in README

THOUGHTS / IDEAS
- Do we need a menu bar app? Sounds appropriate actually.
- Wizard:
	First time we fire up application check for database. If not there, then run the wizard.
		1. A README file, explaining how this all works
		2. First set up a Twitter account remind the user (that somebody needs to be following somebody else) as 
			they will be sending Direct messages to this account.
			Also, remind that they should NOT be using their own account.
			Maybe this is too complicated. Maybe we just check for received stuff from the timeline.
			Research how this all works..k'''''''''''/[;[
		3. Test the twitter account
